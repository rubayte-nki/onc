OncoScape is a package for gene prioritization in the R statistical programming environment. 
The analysis is run in a contrast fashion, i.e. always two groups of samples are compared with each other. 
Examples include:
1. tumors vs. normals
2. cell lines vs. normals
3. treatment responders vs resistant
4. samples with mutations in gene X vs wild type
Currently, analyses of five data types are implemented in OncoScape:
1. gene expression
2. DNA copy number
3. DNA methylation
4. mutation
5. shRNA knock-down data
Aberrations in each gene are called for each data type separately and scored as 0 (no aberration found) or 1 (aberration found). 
These scores are summed across data types to give the final score. OncoScape differentiates between activating (oncogene-like) and inactivating (tumor suppressor-like) 
aberrations and calculates independent scores for both directions. It is possible to run the analysis on any combination of these data types.
