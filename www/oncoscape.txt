<p>OncoScape is a package for gene prioritization in the R statistical programming environment. 
The analysis is run in a contrast fashion, i.e. always two groups of samples are compared with each other. Examples include:
    <ul>
      <li>tumors vs. normals</li>
      <li>cell lines vs. normals</li>
      <li>treatment responders vs resistant</li>
      <li>samples with mutations in gene X vs wild type</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>Currently, analyses of five data types are implemented in OncoScape:
  <ul>
    <li>gene expression</li>
    <li>DNA copy number</li>
    <li>DNA methylation</li>
    <li>mutation</li>
    <li>shRNA knock-down data</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>Aberrations in each gene are called for each data type separately and scored as 0 (no aberration found) or 1 (aberration found). 
These scores are summed across data types to give the final score. OncoScape differentiates between activating (oncogene-like) and inactivating (tumor suppressor-like) 
aberrations and calculates independent scores for both directions. It is possible to run the analysis on any combination of these data types.
